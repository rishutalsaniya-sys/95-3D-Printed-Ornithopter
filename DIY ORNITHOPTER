This repository contains my DIY 3D printed ornithopter project, an experimental mechanical flyer inspired by bird flight. The majority of the structure has been fabricated using 3D printing for precision and ease of replication, while the wings and tail are crafted from lightweight butter paper to keep the design simple and accessible. During test flights, the ornithopter demonstrated smooth and stable flight, proving that the concept works well, though the delicate butter paper wings eventually tore apart after a few runs due to stress. To make this project easy to reproduce or improve upon, I have included STL files for direct 3D printing along with an editable Onshape link so others can customize or redesign parts as needed.
